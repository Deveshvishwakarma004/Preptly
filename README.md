**Preptly** is an **AI-powered interview preparation platform** designed to help candidates sharpen their skills, no matter their role or experience level. The platform dynamically generates interview questions *and* model answers (including explanations), tailored to:

- Role type (e.g. Frontend, Backend, Data Science, Product etc.)  
- Level of experience (e.g. Junior, Mid, Senior)  
- Focus areas (e.g. Algorithms, System Design, Behavioral, Language-specific questions)  

Preptly aims to make interview prep more personalized, efficient, and effective.
